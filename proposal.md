# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Easytodo

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An application to help people to manage their daily tasks.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The user of this software first need to register an account, and then users can add/edit/mark-finish daily tasks freely. When the tasks are completed, they can mark the completion and crossout tasks. The time can also be displayed when the user marks the task finished.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
We will combine MIS 3580 project to this course. Inspiring by the Notes app, we want to create a "To do list" app to help people manage their work and study during the pandemic.
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will collaborate with Zejun Wang. His email address is tuh04717@temple.edu. We have the same TA Tamara Katic.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Require user registration.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Daily tasks can be added.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Can mark task completion and display the date and time.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to learn react-native frame, android studio and javascript to finish this mobile app. Zejun is going to learn javascript and react-native frame, and I will work on the UI design, and android studio.
