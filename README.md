# project-CIS1051

The description of our project.
We created a mobile app called EasyToDo which is a daily taskes manager. We used JavaScript in react-native as our programing lanague. 
Our team have two members, Zejun Wang and Zihao Pan. Zejun Works on coding, and Zihao works on UI designs and Android Studio.

This project requires android studio and react-native environment to start and run. In this application, we are designing an applicatoin that requires user to create an account and login to out application using the registered email and password. After logging in, users could be able to use our application as a daily task manger that allows them to add/edit/crossout/delete their daily tasks to help them manage their schedule.
